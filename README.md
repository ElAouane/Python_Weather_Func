#__MAGIC WEATHER__
# Make a weather/clothing game ## project
# IF statements
# Ask for user input and depending on the response advise on their attire.
#
# prompt user for input
# Evaluate each input and print the appropriate responses
# Follow these rules:
#
# when sunny >> respond with 'take your shorts!'
# stormy >> respond with 'take rain coat'
# rainy >> respond with 'Take your umbrella'
# rainy and stormy >> 'stay home'
# anything else respond with 'sorry, i didn't quite catch that'
# Make it so you keep playing until we say: 'No more Magic'

# OUTCOME: In this project i learned how to control the work flow of the if statments
# nested in a while loop, based on the user input.
# Learning the control flow, helped to understand how to prioritize my if statment 
# and know exactly how and when my code will fire.
